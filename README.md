# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard

## Description

The objective of this project was to develop a Weather Dashboard that will have the capability of displaying the 
weather information for any city in the world. For any city selected, the dashboard displays the current weather information relating to temperature, wind speed and humidity. It also displays a five-day forecast with the same information for the city. This application was built to enable the user check the weather conditions for possible holiday destinations. 

This project was challenging and I learnt how to properly read, understand and utilize API documentation.
